# Feedback-Discovery

The fMRI BOLD synthetic data used in "Causal Discovery of Feedback Networks with Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Data" is available for download in the BOX folder:

XXXXXXXXX

It contains:

1. Networks: Synthetic data for 9 cyclic networks and their amplifying and control variants, resulting in 18 simulations.

2. Macaque Networks: Synthetic data for 4 cyclic networks based on Macaque structural connections from Markov et al., (2013).

3. Pseudo Empirical Networks: Data for 7 networks combining synthetic structures and empirical error terms derived from Poldrack et al.,(2015) MyConnectome resting state fMRI data. The folder also contains anatomical T1, bold raw and bold preprocessed NIfTI files from Poldrack session-014; and Shen et al.,(2013) 278 regions of interest atlas mask in MNI space and in Poldrack native space.
